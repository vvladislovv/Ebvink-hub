# EVINL HUB - ???
 **Evink hub - is a project for two or more games from the same studio. The bottom line is that the player enters one place and enters other games that he wants to play.**

# Description of the game
**The idea is to combine several games. Also, to develop this is to connect one save date and also make a common currency, which in games from this studio can be exchanged for something expensive. We also had an idea to continue the development of this project.**
